# Dependabot usage report

This GitHub Action generates a report of all the repositories in your organization that have a Dependabot configuration file. The report is pushed to a specified repository as a csv file.

### Inputs
`token` (required): A GitHub token with repo scope to push the report to the repository.
`org` (optional): The name of the organization to search for repositories with Dependabot configuration files.

### Outputs
None.

### Example Usage

```yml
name: Dependabot usage

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      org:

jobs:
  dormant-repos:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Get dormant repos
        uses: trojan-actions/dependabot-usage-report@main
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.ORG_TOKEN }}
          org: ${{ github.event.inputs.org }}  
```

In this example, the action is scheduled to run every day at midnight. It checks out the code, generates the report using the action, commits the changes to the repository, and pushes them to the remote repository.

Note that the `GITHUB_TOKEN` secret is used to authenticate with the GitHub API. This token is automatically generated by GitHub and has the necessary permissions to push changes to the repository.
